#Welcome to apprentice.io!

We're excited to have you here. This packet contains information that past
apprentices have found helpful.

We recommend looking through it now and referring back to it later. Think of
this packet as your Hitchhiker's Guide during your apprenticeship. Don't Panic!

This packet is available at https://github.com/thoughtbot/apprentice-onboarding.
Feel free to file a pull request to improve any aspect of it, no matter how tiny.

#The Plan
##Your mentor
Your first mentor's name is: ___________________________________. You'll get a
new mentor each month.

This person is your guide for the month.

## How am I doing?
You should meet with your mentor once a week on Friday to talk through your
progress.

We encourage you to create a backpack page where you list your goals for the
next week and how you did on your goals for the past week. This is a good
document to discuss with your mentor each week. For an example of how previous
apprentices have done this, search in Backpack.  

When you switch mentors, you will have a Mentor Hand-off. This is a meeting with
both mentors to talk through the previous month and the plan for the next month.

## Pairing during the week
You will work with them on client projects Monday-Thursday, traveling with them
to the client site if necessary/appropriate. Your mentor will pair with you
during the week as you work on user stories.  

Pairing is the fastest and most effective way to learn, so it should be a
priority for you and your mentor. However, do not expect to pair 100% of the
time.  One particularly effective method of pairing is Ping-Ponging. The idea is
for Person 1 to write a test, Person 2 writes the code to make the test pass.
Then Person 2 writes the next test and Person 1 writes the code to make the test
pass. Rinse, repeat.

## Self-guided learning
Whenever appropriate or applicable to whatever you are working on, you should
take time away from client work to do some self-guided learning. This can
involve reading chapters in books, attending workshops, or learning about and
trying out a technique/library.  

We recommend starting with Apprenticeship Patterns. 

##Workshops
We encourage learning. We run workshops (learn.thoughtbot.com), which are free
for you. You can and should take advantage of these.

When registering for a workshop, use the coupon code APPRENTICE2012 to register
for free.

We also have a partnership with Bocoup, where you can take any of their
workshops (training.bocoup.com) for free as well.

We have Friday meetings at 3(ish)PM where designers/developers (in separate
meetings) get together to improve their skills. It is impossible to
overemphasize how much learning we want you to do.

##Get a job
We also recognize that you want to be employed at the end of your
apprenticeship.

Your entire third month is focused on finding a job. Chad Pytel will meet with
you at the beginning of your third month to discuss your options and help you
find employers. While you will still be learning, the emphasis is more on
employment.

We prefer that the first two months, conversely, are focused on learning and
not finding employment.


#Getting the Most Out of apprentice.io
## Expectations
Your apprenticeship is an opportunity. The more you put into it, the more you
will get out of it.  

There is some structure to guide you through the program and also people
available to help you along the way, but the engine of this experience is your
effort.  

You should expect this to be a mentally intense period of your life where you
are learning a great deal. Hard work pays off.

## Your trail map
On your first day, fork the Trail Map (github.com/thoughtbot/trail-map) and edit
it with your mentor to find trails that match your goals. It can be any of
trails, but stick with them and track your progress. Also, submitting pull
requests back to the main repo will strengthen the trail map for everyone.

## Feedback

It's not easy, but you should get comfortable asking for and receiving feedback.
People are nice and none of it is personal. It's a great way to develop
professionally.


# Tools and Weapons
## Laptop setup
Your mentor will help you get your laptop set up. We recommend the laptop script
available at https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop.


## Logins
We use many different websites at thoughtbot, and everyone should have
accounts for them. Having access will make it much easier for you to participate
in thoughtbot's internal conversations.

The list of services is below. By the end of your first week, you should have
access to all of them.

### Google apps

URL: http://google.com/a/apprentice.io

You should have received an email with your email (NAME@apprentice.io) and email
password.

We use the calendar extensively - add someone else's calendar to keep
track of what other people are doing.

### Dropbox (http://dropbox.com)

You have access to the "Library" Dropbox folder. This folder contains workshops,
books, papers, and other resources that we've purchased in the past and now
share with everyone at thoughtbot. It's an easy way to learn something for free.

### Tumblr (http://tumblr.com)

Our company blog (http://robots.thoughtbot.com) is actually hosted on Tumblr. In
order to make a blog post, you need a tumblr account. When you have an account,
ask anyone at the company to give you access to the blog. We *strongly*
encourage you to make a blog post!

Even things that you think are silly, like a git tip that takes 3 lines and that
you're *sure* everyone else knows, is worthy of a blog post. Often our most
popular blog posts are the ones that we thought were the silliest. For example,
http://j.mp/LP72NP is pretty dumb but got 18 comments.

We also have a semi-secret blog of Campfire quotes at
http://tinyrobots.thoughtbot.com.

## 37Signals Suite (Basecamp/Backpack/Campfire)

37signals runs a suite of applications that we use. You should have received a
37Signals invitation in your apprentice.io email. Ensure that you have access
to the following:

  - Campfire: http://thoughtbot.campfirenow.com/
  - Backpack: https://thoughtbot.backpackit.com/
  - Basecamp: https://basecamp.com/1719045

If any of those sites give you an error, talk to your mentor.
Once you have access to Backpack, check out this onboarding page:
https://thoughtbot.backpackit.com/pages/2661936-employee-onboarding. There's
probably overlap, and we'd love feedback!

## Trajectory

We use Trajectory to manage our projects. Each client has their own
account, and your mentor will invite you to whichever project you are 
assigned to.

If you'd like to get familiar with Trajectory before your apprenticeship, 
you can create a free account at https://www.apptrajectory.com/plans. 

### Campfire

We use Campfire *constantly*. Use a desktop Campfire client like Propane
(http://propaneapp.com/); it's much better than the web interface. It will ask
you to register it when you start it, but you can ignore that and it will work
fine.

Campfire has rooms with a specific purpose:

* Everyone: discuss things that interest everyone. You should be in this room
  whenever you are working.
* Code: discuss your code. When asking a question, pasting your code is
  encouraged.
* Design: discuss design topics or cool design that you've encountered.
* Watercooler (a/k/a WC): this is where we  post animated GIFs and lolcats. Don't
  post lolcats in other rooms. Sometimes you'll be told "WC!" - that means you
  should take it to Watercooler.
* Most of the other rooms are specific to projects and are named after the
  project.

Designers and developers should check out the Code and Design rooms - everyone's
welcome in every room.

### Basecamp

Basecamp is where we put ideas that we want to discuss, like product ideas or a
new Git workflow.

### Backpack

We have things like general company policies and non-technical discussion and
announcements in backpack. If you have a question about anything HR related,
look in backpack first.

You should use your homepage in Backpack (there's a link in the Backpack
sidebar) to track your progress.

### Dotfiles

Dotfiles are the files in your home directory (referred to as "~") that start
with a dot, like "~/.bashrc". They are used to configure various programs, e.g.
"~/.vimrc" sets some global options for "vim". Take a look at thoughtbot's
dotfiles (https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles), and feel free to fork them.
We also encourage you to check out your coworkers' dotfiles for inspiration. For
example, Josh Clayton has an extensive configuration for tmux in his dotfiles:
https://github.com/joshuaclayton/dotfiles/blob/master/tmux.conf.

# Community
Part of your apprenticeship is learning to be part of a development community.
This could be a Ruby Meetup Group, company, or project team.

## Meeting people is easy
We are a friendly bunch and we'd like to get to know you better! That being
said, it's easy to feel intimidated or uncomfortable in a new environment. Some
things you should try:

* Go on coffee walks: we often have informal "coffee walks" at 3-ish, where
  people go for a walk (coffee optional) and chat about random topics.

* Go get lunch/coffee/breakfast with anyone in the office.

* Suggest a social event for your project team.

## Who?
If you're having trouble matching names to faces, check out
http://thoughtbot.com/about, which has pictures and names of everyone at the
company (except apprentices).


## Development Discussions

We have weekly development discussions most Fridays from 3-4pm in a conference
room upstairs. We discuss topics like how to design object oriented systems and
the style guide. Development apprentices especially are strongly encouraged to
attend.

## Design Discussions

We hold these at 3(ish) PM on Fridays when there are enough designers. It's a
place to show off what you've been working on as well as a mini-critique.
Designer apprentices are strongly encouraged to attend.

## Boston.rb

The boston ruby group (bostonrb.org/calendar) meets every Tuesday, alternating
Project Nights (where people hack together) and presentations. It's a great
place to learn something, as well as to practice your public speaking by
submitting a talk. Speaking at boston.rb is great practice since it's a
smallish, friendly audience, and it gives your resume a nice bump.

#Improve apprentice.io
We encourage you to propose changes to the apprentice process, including hiring,
onboarding, and anything else that you think could be better. Everyone at
thoughtbot is constantly trying to do a better job and we welcome feedback.

As an apprentice, you have much better insight into what could make the process
better for you than does someone who's been working here for five years.

Feedback is always, always appreciated on everything at thoughtbot. If you have
feedback on the overall apprentice program, please contact Gabe Berke-Williams,
the head of the apprentice.io program.
