# Welcome to Your Apprenticeship

We're excited to have you here. This packet contains information that past
apprentices have found helpful.

We recommend looking through it now and referring back to it later. Think of
this packet as your Hitchhiker's Guide during your apprenticeship. Don't Panic!

This packet is available at [https://github.com/thoughtbot/apprenticeship].
Feel free to file a pull request to improve any aspect of it, no matter how tiny.

# The Plan

Your first two months are spent learning. At the end of your second month,
you'll meet with your Director to discuss your promotion to a thoughtbot
developer or designer.

If either you or we have decided that thoughtbot is not for you, no worries.
We can work with you over the next month to help find job prospects.

Don't worry! We will do everything we can to make your three months as amazing
as we can and prepare you for your step after the apprenticeship.

## Your mentor

Your first mentor's name is: \_________________________\_. You'll get a
new mentor each month.

This person is your guide for the month.

## How am I doing?

You will meet with your mentor once a week on Friday to talk through your
progress.

You are encouraged to create a list of the goals you have for your
apprenticeship on an overall basis as well as to maintain a weekly list of
smaller, specific goals. You should work with your mentor to set these and track
your progress against them.

For an example of how previous apprentices have done this, see the
[apprentice-goals project](https://github.com/thoughtbot/apprentice-goals) on
GitHub You should consider creating a pull request in that repository to
contribute your own goals.

When you switch mentors, you will have a Mentor Hand-off meeting. This is a
meeting with both mentors to talk through the previous month and the plan for
the next month.

## Pairing during the week

You will work with your mentor on client projects Monday-Thursday,
traveling with them to the client site if appropriate. Your mentor will pair
with you during the week as you work on user stories.

Pairing is the fastest and most effective way to learn, so it should be a
priority for you and your mentor. However, do not expect to pair 100% of the
time. One particularly effective method of pairing is Ping-Ponging. The idea is
for Person 1 to write a test, Person 2 writes the code to make the test pass.
Then Person 2 writes the next test and Person 1 writes the code to make the test
pass. Rinse, repeat.

We also encourage you to pair with other apprentices (designer/developer teams
work great) as well as with thoughtbot employees who are not your mentor.
Everyone on the team loves teaching and learning, and they'd love to teach and
learn from you. A good way to do it is to announce during standup that you're
looking for someone to pair with, and if people have free time (usually only
Fridays, since that's when everyone gets a break from client work), they'll tell
you.

## Self-guided learning

Whenever appropriate or applicable to your work, you should take time away from
client work to do some self-guided learning. This can include reading material
from books, attending workshops, or learning about and trying out a technique
or library.

For reading material, we recommend starting with Apprenticeship Patterns, which
is available in the Library folder in the thoughtbot Dropbox.

## Workshops

We encourage learning. We sell workshops and webcasts
[Upcase](https://upcase.com), thoughtbot's subscription learning platform. These
are free to all thoughtbot employees and you are encouraged to take advantage of
them.

Ask your mentor to add you to the thoughtbot team in Upcase if you do not
already have access.

# Getting the Most Out of Your Apprenticeship

## Expectations

Your apprenticeship is an opportunity. The more you put into it, the more you
will get out of it.

There is some structure to guide you through the program and also people
available to help you along the way, but the engine of this experience is your
effort. Learning should take up some of your evening/weekend time.

You should expect this to be a mentally intense period of your life where you
are learning a great deal. Hard work pays off.

## Breakable Toy

A [Breakable Toy](http://redsquirrel.com/dave/work/a2j/patterns/BreakableToys.html)
is a side Rails project you are excited and passionate about.

This project should be an anchor to your learning, allowing you to raise new
questions and a place to apply new skills/techniques. To get the most out of it,
you should put the code in GitHub and give your mentors and apprentice cohort
access to the project. You should also deploy it to Heroku.

There is no expectation for other apprentices to contribute to your project, but
everyone should have access and input is welcome.

A team that has a designer apprentice and a developer apprentice has worked very
well for both designer and developer in the past.  Don't be afraid to ask if
someone wants to work with you!

## Investment Days

thoughtbot is proud to offer employees unguided investment time. Team members
generally take this time to work on open source projects, blog posts, internal
thoughtbot projects or to participate in lightning talks, book clubs, etc. See
[https://robots.thoughtbot.com/investment-time] for more background on investment
time.

## Feedback

It's not easy, but you should get comfortable asking for and receiving feedback.
People are nice and none of it is personal. It's a great way to develop
professionally.

# Tools

## Laptop setup

Your mentor will help you get your laptop set up. We recommend the laptop script
available at [https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop].

### Dotfiles

Dotfiles are the files in your home directory (referred to as "~") that start
with a dot, like "~/.bashrc". They are used to configure various programs, e.g.
"~/.vimrc" sets some global options for Vim. Take a look at [thoughtbot's
dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles), and feel free to fork them.

## Logins

We use many different websites at thoughtbot, and everyone should have
accounts for them. Having access will make it much easier for you to participate
in thoughtbot's internal conversations.

The list of services is below. By the end of your first week, you should have
access to all of them.

### Google apps

You should have received an email with your email (NAME@thoughtbot.com) and
email password.

We use the calendar extensively - add someone else's calendar to keep
track of what other people are doing.

### Dropbox

You have access to the "Library" Dropbox folder. This folder contains workshops,
books, papers, and other resources that we've purchased in the past and now
share with everyone at thoughtbot. It's an easy way to learn something for free.

### GitHub

Your GitHub account should have access to private thoughtbot repositories such
as our blog (robots.thoughtbot.com). You should also have access to your client
project. Work with your mentor if you do not have access.

### Slack

We use [Slack](http://thoughtbot.slack.com) *constantly*. Slack has many rooms,
each with a specific purpose:

* general: discuss things that interest everyone. You should be in this room
  whenever you are working.
* dev, ruby, xcoders: discussions of code. When asking a question, pasting
  your code is encouraged.
* design: discuss design topics or cool designs that you've encountered.
* catrs: funny links and off-topic discussions.
* san-francisco, boston, denver, raleigh, philly: Location-specific discussions,
  like lunch and office happenings.
* Most of the other rooms are specific to projects and are named after the
  project.

Both designers and developers should check out both the `dev` and
`design` channels - everyone is welcome in every channel.

### Constable

We use [Constable](https://constable.io) for company wide announcements and
other asynchronous topics of discussion relating to various
[interests](https://constable.io/interests). You should be sure to subscribe to
the interest relating to your office so you are promptly notified of any
important local news.

### Trello

Most of our client and internal projects use Trello boards for project
management. If you don't already have a Trello account, you can log in using
your thoughtbot email. Your mentor should help you get access to the boards you
need. You should have access to the Trello board (or other project management
system if appropriate) for your client project and also several internal
thoughtbot boards.

# Community

Part of your apprenticeship is learning to be part of a development community.
This could be a Ruby Meetup Group, company, or project team.

## Meeting People

We are a friendly bunch and we'd like to get to know you better! That being
said, it's easy to feel intimidated or uncomfortable in a new environment. Some
things you should try:

* Go on coffee walks: we often have informal "coffee walks" at 3-ish, where
  people go for a walk (coffee optional) and chat about random topics.

* Go get lunch/coffee/breakfast with anyone in the office.

* Suggest a social event for your project team.

### Friday Lunches

We order lunch for the whole office each Friday! Please let our office manager
know if you have any allergies or dietary restrictions.

## Who?

If you're having trouble matching names to faces, check out
[http://thoughtbot.com/locations], which has pictures and names of everyone at
the company (except apprentices). Slack avatars also tend to be handy in this
regard.

## Boston.rb

The [Boston Ruby Group](http://bostonrb.org/calendar) meets every other Tuesday,
alternating project nights (where people hack together) and presentations.
It's a great place to learn something, as well as to practice your public
speaking by submitting a talk. Speaking at Boston.rb is great practice since
it's a smallish, friendly audience, and it gives your résumé a nice bump.

The Boston.rb project nights are hosted at the thoughtbot office, which makes
them very easy to attend.

# Improve The Apprentice Program

We encourage you to propose changes to the apprentice process, including hiring,
onboarding, and anything else that you think could be better. Everyone at
thoughtbot is constantly trying to do a better job and we welcome feedback.

As an apprentice, you have much better insight into what could make the process
better for you than does someone who's been working here for five years.

Feedback is always, always appreciated on everything at thoughtbot. If you have
feedback on the overall apprentice program, please contact Gabe Berke-Williams,
the head of the apprentice program.
